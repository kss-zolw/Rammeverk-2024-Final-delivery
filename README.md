### How to run:

This webscraper is tested with Python version 3.12.3
Some packages and code will probably work with older versions of python, but that has not been tested.

Steps to get the webscraper up and running:

* Unzip to a suitable location on your computer.
* Open a terminal in the unzipped folder
* create a python virtual environment
````
> python3 -m venv venv
````
* activate the virtual environment 
````
Visual Studio Code will activate it with a message popup.
# or run this:
> /venv/Scripts/activate.ps1
# or
> /venv/Scripts/activate.bat
````
If you are on unix systems
````
> source venv/bin/activate
````
* install python dependencies to the virtual environment
````
(venv) > pip3 install -r requirements.txt
````
